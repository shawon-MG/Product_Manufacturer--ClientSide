                        <h1 class="text-center text-5xl font-bold">FOUNDER and CEO</h1>
                        <p class="py-6">Twenty years ago, CHIRU President and CEO, Pierre Arnaud Le Magnan, was hired by a major french bike company to perform stress test analysis on new bike designs. He went on to design and build carbon-fiber sports products and design ideas for mountain bikes. He has owned and operated a custom automobile parts manufacturing company for many years using both metal and carbon technologies.

                            Pierre's passion for innovative and optimised bike design is so strong, he felt it was time to take it to the next level; thus starting CHIRU bikes in 2009. As a result of his expertise, know-how, endless testing sessions and racing experience, CHIRU has created a unique, high end mountain bike for the discerning rider and racer.

                            Carbon fiber technology applied to bicycle frames is  reliable and widely accepted. The benefits from high performance-weight ratio and superior vibration damping will satisfy the most demanding XC marathon racers. However, Pierre believes that Titanium allows full rigid bikes for a more compliant ride, a more resilient behavior, life time warranty and recyclabilityâ€¦This is the reason why all the ultra-Endurance line is build-up using the best titanium tubing combined with an amazing craftmanship !

                            CHIRU bike's philosophy focuses on power transfer, comfort and reliability, this makes CHIRU frames more responsive, more efficient and very exciting to ride.</p>
